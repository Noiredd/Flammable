Get code directly from the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/Noiredd/Flammable.git`

Now install it. This will copy the code to your `site-packages`,
allowing you to do `import flammable` in your code.
Additionally, a global repository for all of your experiments will be created.
You will be asked to enter a path to store it.

`cd Flammable`  
`python setup.py install`

That's it!
